# Hyperledger Fabric chaincode kit (CCKit)

## Encryption extension

Allows to encrypt all data in ledger

Based on [example](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/examples/chaincode/go/enccc_example)


## Using ECDH for establishing secret key 

ECDH (Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman): both parties can establish a secret value by sending only the public key 
of their ephemeral or static key pair to the other party. If the key pair of one of the parties is trusted by the other
party then that key pair may also be used for authentication.
